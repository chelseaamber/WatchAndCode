# WatchAndCode Tutorial
To Do List inspired by https://watchandcode.com course
## Requirements:
- create a space for todos to exist 
- create ability to add todos 
- create ability to display todos 
- object orient everything 

## Extra Requirements (That I created):
### HTML & CSS:
- set up page display
- create buttons & interactions of these buttons
- CSS code
### javascript functions:
- categorise To Do's
* Do this via colour or via nominated categories such as work, uni?
* I think colour would be better 
* Colours: #ffb3ba, #ffdfba, #ffffba,#baffc9, #bae1ff
* input function connected to addtodo method
